Card game for the first-year Programming project in Computer Science 2024. The project rules and requirements are outlined in the gwent-pro.pdf file. The chosen theme was the Cuban Revolutionary War of 1956-1959, which led to the downfall of the Batista dictatorship. The gameâ€™s graphical interface was created in Unity. Upon completion of the deadline, the game will also be uploaded as a .exe and .apk file. I hope you find my work enjoyable!
